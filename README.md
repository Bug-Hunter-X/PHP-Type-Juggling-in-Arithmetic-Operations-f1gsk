This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP related to type juggling. The `calculateSum` function attempts to sum an array that includes a string value ('4a').  PHP's loose typing system attempts to convert this string to a number, but this can lead to unexpected results. The solution demonstrates how to explicitly check the type of each element before performing the summation.
